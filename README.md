# Codename Barchette

A realistic 3D simulator for autonomous boat agents, built in Unity3D and MLAgents with realistic liquid simulation (ZibraAI plugin).    
The projects featurs a realistic environment, a coarse reconstruction of the port of Garda, Italy facing the lake, including the city coatline and a real bathymetry of the lake.    
The vistual boat is equipped with realistic, modular sensors for GPS, IMG, lidar and sonar.    
Two modular engines are provided: a classic rudder-tilt engine and a double differential engine.
